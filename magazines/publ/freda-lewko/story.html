  <h3>FAR AWAY STABLES CHAT WITH US ABOUT THEIR UPCOMING AUSTRALIA TOUR</h3>
  <h4>19 August 2015 // By Jen Rees</h4>

  <h5>Far Away Stables are set to embark on their biggest tour to date this September & October, with four all-ages performances across the East Coast & Adelaide, in support of the digital re-release of Atlantis and the new single <i>Victim</i>. I have seen them a few times now and have followed their career. I am immensely proud of them in the growth and maturity of their sound and they are really down-to-earth, nice guys. I encourage you to give them a listen and go see a show on this tour. Tickets and more info are available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/646430202160046/" target="_blank">here</a> and you can follow all their news on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FarAwayStables?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</h5>
<h5 class="bold"><span class="red">MI:</span> Hi Tim, thanks for your time today. You have been making music together now for three years. When you started out, did you think that in three years you would have a US and Canadian tour under your belt and have supported some pretty high-profile bands?</h5>

<h5><span class="red">TIM BYLES:</span> Whilst we have had some relatively lofty goals since day one, it still blows our mind to this day that [we’ve done] some of the things we’ve been lucky enough to do.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">I have seen you guys a few times over the years. The main ones I can remember are with The Offspring, The Getaway Plan and The Sweet Apes. I'm sure there have been lots more as I go to a lot of local gigs at Wrangler Studios. What has been a highlight performance for you? Can you tell us about your best gig?</h5>

<h5>Touring with The Offspring was an absolute, insane experience. <i>Americana</i> was the first album that I ever bought, and being able to bring that CD backstage and thank them personally was very surreal. Being able to sneak some drinks to my Dad from backstage was pretty awesome too.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">Can you tell us a bit about your US and Canada tour? Highlights? Funny stories?</h5>

<h5>We essentially spent two months playing colleges across the States, as well as hitting up SXSW and Canadian Music Week. That was an amazing experience for us, and we are doing everything we can to go back there. The entire trip was a massive learning experience for us, and we really grew as a band and as friends. This was definitely a massive bucket list experience for myself and the boys.</h5>

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EAjXQkTVp4E?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<h5 class="bold">Why do you think that you get played more on the radio in the US than Australia?</h5>

<h5>Two very different markets. College radio has a big say in taste-making in the States, and is a little bit kinder to the alternative/rock scene. However, UNFD has had three feature albums on JJJ in the past couple of months, so I’m really hoping for the next big wave of guitar music to come back into the mainstream.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">When you arrived back in Australia after so many shows and miles that the five of you shared, do you think it made you closer to each other?</h5>

<h5>Most definitely. We had some hard times on the road — as you would with anyone you’d be spending every waking hour with — but it was a huge experience and [I] wouldn’t have wanted anyone else there with me.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">I remember first hearing <i>What Are You Waiting For?</i> and thinking how clean the vocals were and the song stayed in my mind even on the drive home. It still is one of my favourite Aussie band songs. I am glad that you are re-releasing <i>Atlantis</i>. Will you re-release <i>What Are You Waiting For?</i></h5>

<h5>Thank you so much for saying [that]. Writing that song was a big turning point in the band. In fact, I believe Soundwave sent that song to Paramore and that is what got us the final approval for their support, so it definitely means a lot to us, and will most certainly be on the re-release.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">In September/October you are about to commence your biggest tour to date. You are playing four AA shows in major cities — are you going to follow this with any regional shows?</h5>

<h5>Unfortunately, not as of yet. This whole tour was meant to just be one show that grew a bit out of control, but we will certainly be focusing on some regional dates when we find some time.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">You are touring due to the re-release of <i>Atlantis</i> and your new single <i>Victim</i>. I have listened to <i>Victim</i> a few times now — was this written from personal experience? The song allows the listener to feel the pain and hurt in the song. I think that everyone can relate to and would love to sing it at someone in their past.</h5>

<h5>These are definitely some of the most personal lyrics I’ve ever written, and I’m thrilled you’re able to find something in them! I was hoping that someone would find some past instance of themselves that they’d like to direct this song to.</h5>

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVKmmu-vInc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<h5 class="bold">How does your writing process go? Is there a whole band approach? The lyrics to your songs are so easy to connect to.</h5>

<h5>The song writing process is constantly changing. In fact, this was the first song I ever brought to the band.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">You have been busy making a music video for <i>Victim</i>. When will that be released?</h5>

<h5>Just released it this second actually!</h5>

<h5 class="bold">Who came up with the concept for the video?</h5>

<h5>Myself and Brendan actually — literally the day before the shoot.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">I’ve been checking out your Facebook page and read that you are heading to Indonesia next month for Annabel Souls AU, can you tell us about that?</h5>

<h5>That’s right, we have some good friends who run this epic clothing company in Indonesia and we’ve been throwing ideas back and forth of how to make this happen. One thing lead to another and we leave in a few weeks. The boys have never been to Indonesia before, so [I] can’t wait to explore this beautiful country with them!</h5>

<h5 class="bold">I would love for you to know that your cover of <i>To Build A Home</i> (The Cinematic Orchestra) in my opinion is an improvement on the original (no offense to them!) Both live and studio versions are amazing. Perhaps it might be like <i>Stacey’s Mom</i> and Bowling for Soup!</h5>

<h5 class="bold">When playing covers live, does it have a different feel than playing your own songs?</h5>

<h5>That’s a huge compliment to us as we think the original is one of the best songs ever composed, so thank you! This is the second cover we have done and after a while they really do begin to feel like home. You become just as attached to them as you would your own songs.</h5>

<h5 class="bold">I wish you well on your Australian tour and for the release of <i>Victim</i> .I hope you get airplay here as much as in the US! Thanks for your time and see you in Melbourne!</h5>

<h5>Come and say hi! And thank you for having us!</h5>

<h5 class="bold">My pleasure, Tim.</h5>
