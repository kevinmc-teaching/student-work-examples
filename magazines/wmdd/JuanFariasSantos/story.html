              <h3>Old Muscle: 69' Mustang Overview</h3>
              <h4>by Juan Santos</h4>
              <p>
                The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of
                automobile known as the pony car. Here we dive into this icon.

              <p>
                The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from
                March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang created a
                new class of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustangâ€™s
                styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly
                popular and inspired a host of competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and
                convertible with the fastback version put on sale in August
                1964. At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its
                underpinnings with the Falcon, was slotted into a compact car
                segment.
              </p>

              <p>
                With each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall
                dimensions and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic
                redesign to its predecessors. After an initial surge, sales were
                steadily declining, as Ford began working on a new generation
                Mustang. With the onset of the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was
                prepared, having already designed the smaller Mustang II for the
                1974 model year. This new car had no common components with
                preceding models.
              </p>

              <p>
                The 1969 model year restyle "added more heft to the body" with
                body length extended by 3.8 inches (97 mm) (the wheelbase
                remaining at 108 inches), width increased by almost half an
                inch, and the Mustang's "weight went up markedly too." 1969 was
                the first model to use quad headlamps placed both inside and
                outside the grille opening. The corralled grille pony was
                replaced with the pony and tribars logo, set off-center to the
                driver's side. The car was longer than previous models and
                sported convex rather than concave side panels. The fastback
                body version was named SportsRoof in Ford's literature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 1969 model year saw the introduction of the Mach 1, with a
                variety of powerplants options and many new styling and
                performance features. Distinctive reflective striping was placed
                along the body sides, with a pop-open gas cap, dual exhausts,
                matte-black hood with simulated air scoop and NASCAR-style cable
                and pin tiedowns. It used steel wheels with bold-lettered
                Goodyear Polyglas tires. A functional "shaker" hood scoop -
                which visibly vibrated by being attached directly to the air
                cleaner through a hole in the hood - was available, as were
                tail-mounted wing and chin spoilers and rear window louvered
                blackout shade. The Mach 1 featured a deluxe interior with
                simulated wood trim, high backed seats, extra sound deadening,
                remote sports mirrors and other comforts. The Mach 1 proved
                popular with buyers with 72,458 cars sold through 1969.

                The Boss 302 was created to meet Trans Am rules and featured
                distinctive hockey-stick stripes, while the understated Boss 429
                was created to homologate the Boss 429 engine (based on the new
                Ford 385 series engine) for NASCAR use. The two Boss models
                received fame on the track and street and to this day they still
                demand premium pricing for their pedigree. 1628 Boss 302's and
                859 Boss 429's were sold through 1969 - making these vehicles
                somewhat rare.

                A new "luxury" model became available starting for 1969,
                available in only the hardtop body style. The 'Grande' featured
                a soft ride, 55 pounds (24.9 kg) of extra sound deadening, as
                well as deluxe interior with simulated wood trim. It was popular
                with buyers with 22182 units sold through 1969.

                Amidst other special editions, the 1969 Mustang E was offered
                for those desiring high mpg. The 1969 Limited Edition Mustang E
                was a rare (about 50 produced) fastback special model designed
                for economy. It came with a six-cylinder engine (250 cu in (4.1
                L)), a high stall torque converter for the standard automatic
                transmission and a very low, 2.33:1 rear axle ratio. Mustang E
                lettering on the rear quarters identified the special Mustang
                E.[60] Air conditioning was not available on the 'E' model.[58]
              </p>
              <p>
                The Mustang GT was discontinued in 1969 due to poor sales versus
                the success of the new Mach 1 with only 5396 GT models sold that
                year.
