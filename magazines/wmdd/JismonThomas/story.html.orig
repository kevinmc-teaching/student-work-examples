		  				Giorgio Armani is an Italian fashion designer, particularly noted for his menswear. He is known today for his clean, tailored lines. He formed his company, Armani, in 1975, and by 2001 was acclaimed as the most successful designer that Italy has produced, with an annual turnover of $1.6 billion and a personal fortune of $8.5 billion as of 2013. He is credited with pioneering red-carpet fashion.

		  			<h2>Design career</h2>
		  			<p>
		  				After his stint in the armed forces, Armani found a job as a window dresser at La Rinascente, a department store in Milan. He went on to become a seller for the menswear department, in which capacity he gained valuable experience in the marketing aspect of the fashion industry. In the mid-1960s, Armani moved to the Nino Cerruti company, for which he designed menswear. His skills were in demand, and for the next decade, while continuing to work for Cerutti, Armani also freelanced,contributing designs to as many as ten manufacturers at a time. In the late 1960s, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman, which marked the beginning of a personal and professional relationship that lasted for many years. In 1973, Galeotti persuaded him to open a design office in Milan, at 37 corso Venezia. This led to a period of extensive collaboration, during which Armani worked as a freelance designer for a number of fashion houses, including Allegri, Bagutta, Hilton, Sicons, Gibò, Montedoro, and Tendresse. The international press was quick to acknowledge Armani's importance following the runway shows at the Sala Bianca in the Pitti Palace in Florence. The experience provided Armani with an opportunity to develop his own style in new ways. He was now ready to devote his energy to his own label, and in 1975 he founded Giorgio Armani S.p.A. in Milan, with his friend Galeotti. In October of that same year, he presented his first collection of men's ready-to-wear for Spring and Summer 1976 under his own name. He also produced a women's line for the same season.

			  				Armani established an innovative relationship with industry, characterized by the 1978 agreement with Gruppo Finanzario Tessile (GFT), which made it possible to produce luxury ready-to-wear in a manufacturing environment under the attentive supervision of the company's designer. In 1983 the designer modified his agreement with GFT. They began to produce both the Mani line for the United States and his high-end ready-to-wear line, rechristened Borgonuovo 21, after the address of the company's headquarters. During the late 1980s, despite Galeotti's death (1985), Armani continued to expand commercial horizons and licensing agreements. He opened Armani Japan and introduced a line of eyeglasses (1988), socks (1987), a gift collection (1989), and a new "basic" men's and women's line for America known as A/X Armani Exchange (1991). After the frenetic expansion of the 1990s (sportswear, watches, eyeglasses, cosmetics, home, and new accessories collections), 2000, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the brand, saw a flurry of investment activity, including stock sales and the acquisition of new manufacturing capacity intended to increase Armani's control over the quality and distribution of his products.

		  				In 1996 his long-time friend Eric Clapton composed some songs for Armani's fashion shows and is since dressed in Armani. Later that year Clapton opened two Emporio Armani stores in New York City. In 1998 Armani hosted a party for Clapton Crossroads guitar auction.

						He also prepared to break in the Chinese market by opening up his first store in that country in 1998. The small shop in Beijing was followed by a flagship store in Shanghai in 2004 and plans for 40 by 2011. In 2000, Giorgio Armani SpA was introducing new lines of cosmetics and home furnishings, and expanding its line of accessories. At the same time, the Guggenheim Museum in New York hosted an exhibition of Armani's work, a first for a living designer. With average attendance of 29,000 a week, the show featured Armani's eveningwear for women which, although one of the designer's strong areas, was not even his main interest.

						In 2008, Armani designed the bullfighting costume, called the "Goyesco", worn by Spanish bullfighter Cayetano Rivera Ordóñez at the "Corrida Goyesca" in Ronda, Spain. They have also collaborated on several fashion shows and other events.

						As of 2009, Armani has a retail network of 60 Giorgio Armani boutiques, 11 Collezioni, 122 Emporio Armani, 94 A/X Armani exchange, 1 Giorgio Armani Accessori, and 13 Armani Junior stores spread over 37 different countries.

		  			<h2>Innovations</h2>
		  			<p>
		  				Armani was the first designer to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18, after model
						model Ana Carolina Reston starved herself to death due to anorexia nervosa. Armani broadcast 
						his collection live on the Internet, the first in the world of haute couture, on 24 January 2007. 
						The Armani Privé Spring/Summer 2007 fashion show was broadcast 
						via MSN and Cingular cellular phones.After LG teamed with Prada to introduce the LG Prada 
						phone, Samsung joined Armani to design the Giorgio Armani phone. Armani has designed many 
						stage outfits for pop superstar Lady Gaga, including those worn on her record breaking Monster 
						Ball Tour and Born This Way Ball Tour. In addition, he has also designed for many high-profile 
						award shows, such as the52nd Grammy Awards and the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.
		  			</p>
		  			<h2>Music</h2>
		  			<p>
		  				Armani Musica presents Emporio Armani Caffè compilations, a series of special CD
						compilations curated by Giorgio Armani with dj-sound designer Matteo Ceccarini, offering an 
						eclectic mix of conceptual sounds and underground rhythms.
		  			</p>
		  			<h2>Sports</h2>
		  			<p>
		  				Giorgio Armani has a keen interest in sports. He is the president of the Olimpia Milanobasketball 
						team and an Inter Milan fan. He has twice designed suits for the England national football team. 
						He has since designed suits worn by players of the London club Chelsea since August 2007. He 
						designed the Italian flag bearers' outfits at the opening ceremony at the 2006 Winter 
						Olympics in Turin and also designed Italy's Olympic uniforms for the 2012 Summer Olympics in 
						London.
