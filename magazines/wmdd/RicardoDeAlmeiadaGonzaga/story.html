			<h1>Skateboarding Is Officially an Olympic Sport.<br>What Now?</h1>

			<h2>The votes are in, and the Games are coming. Where do we go from here?</h2>

				<p>On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee did what seemed all but inevitable and greenlit skateboarding for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo by way of a unanimous vote.</p>

				<p>So with the conversation shifting from “what if” to “what now,” we can all stop debating whether skateboarding is a sport and digest what its admission to the Olympics actually means. The best starting point I can offer you is an anecdote about a program that aired in 1990 on Nickelodeon titled SK8 TV, a series that was created by three Z-Boys, including director Stacy Peralta.</p>

				<p>The general consensus among skateboarders was that SK8 TV was a show for kids, which was Peralta’s intention. But even if it was the butt of a few jokes, there was no large-scale outrage, and skateboarding getting a TV show really didn’t have a lasting cultural impact. It was, however, also a lot of people’s introduction to Jeremy Klein, Ron Chatman, Ed Templeton, Andy Howell, and other legends, which isn’t a bad thing. But, ultimately, the exposure it offered didn’t save skateboarding from the collapse it was on the precipice of. It also didn’t land skating in the Olympics or really do much other than provide some content that everyone watched, whether or not they want to admit it more than a quarter-century later.</p>

				<p>While SK8 TV is a blip in skate history, it was the first time that skateboarding was beamed into homes across America and maybe the world regularly. At a time when the only way to view series was on a tube television, with a fraction of the channels available to us now, it didn’t change much. There was no streaming content or Internet content, nor was there anything to download. Your other option was VHS.</p>

				<p>By 2020, when skateboarding debuts in the Olympics, streaming will have continued to eclipse linear television. Provided they even give a shit, most will be watching the Games on a tablet or phone, or maybe even by way of a virtual-reality-enabled device. Sheckler, Malto, and Shane O’Neill will all be 30-ish years old, and Nyjah a ripe 25. There’s also a very good chance they’ll be riding for entirely new companies or that none of them will have a board sponsor.</p>

				<p>But what does this all really mean, and how will it affect the industry, if at all? Let’s start by chopping up the skate world into bits, focusing on the fraction of skate athletes who aspire to skate in the Olympics. These people will be subject to stricter drug testing, forced to wear uniforms, and focused on an unpaid event for which they’ll most likely have to compete year round to qualify. What, exactly, will that event be? According to Wednesday’s announcement, it will include men’s and women’s street and park events. The park events will pack a little Olympic drama, but count on the street section to be largely boring.</p>

				<p>How do I know this? Because no street contest has ever captured the excitement of a well-edited video part. And because, to the average viewer, skateboarding, in its rawest form, is pretty fucking boring to watch. Isn't that the running cliché—that we don’t actually land tricks? To a spectator, that has historically been true. I get the idea behind it, but watching skateboarding in an arena isn’t a sensational experience, especially if you’re in the cheap seats. So witnessing a flawless switch hardflip nosegrind 180 out the hard way will never have the appeal of seeing someone speeding toward an icy jump, flipping around, and maybe breaking their legs in the name of a perfect 10 on a pair of skis. Sadly, to the casual fan, organized skateboarding is more akin to curling.</p>

				<p>So, then, the verdict? Less drugs, less viewership, less interest, and more rules. Skateboarding doesn’t project to be a “money” sport, meaning that the top-tier athletes are still paid closer to the average WNBA salary per year, which is currently around $72,000—a far cry from the multimillion-dollar salaries baseball, basketball, and football players command. It’s a sport based on endorsements, so it’s not economically viable for 99.9 percent of the people who pursue it as a career. You know this shit, though, right? I don’t have to really break it down much further.</p>

				<p>But let’s put aside the people on the board for a minute and take a look at the industry itself and the potential impact it could feel. For brands that exist by 2020, sales of completes in chain stores, provided those also exist in four years, will see an uptick. Will decks ever be sold in the same way unstrung tennis rackets are in sporting goods stores? Probably not, but the price-point complete will be fine and might even benefit from having an “Olympic Gold Medalist [Skater X]” sticker slapped on its shrink-wrap. This could also expand global sales for brands, especially in countries like Iran, where skating is gaining traction.</p>

				<p>And we’ll need more filmers and lawyers and agents and photographers and writers—if people still read things—and editors and content managers and website designers and all that boring shit to serve skating and skaters. So there should, in theory, be more jobs. But there are four more occupations whose ranks will swell and come under more scrutiny than all of the aforementioned combined: trainers, managers, skate physicians, and skate judges.</p>

				<p>Because of all the Olympic mandates, trainers might have to change some of their practices and what they prescribe for someone rehabbing an injury. But the skate judge thing is really tricky, because at least a few judges currently work for brands that also happen sponsor skaters who compete in contests. You can’t take a check from a company that plays in the skateboarding economy and be expected to assign an impartial numerical value to a trick executed by a rider whose sponsor pays you. I’m going to assume that some of these people will opt to be coaches, but who the hell will be judging these things fairly? Good luck finding experts who aren’t biased, especially in skateboarding.</p>

				<p>There—that’s settled. Now on to the rest of Planet Earth. Guess what: Skateboarding is now a sport. So what does that mean for you? It won’t change how you view and dissect your favorite parts, edits, and photographs. It won’t sway your purchases or determine the height at which you cuff your pants. Cops and security guards will still dislike you, though the local parks might have more people riding skateboards, rather than bikes and scooters. And, yes, you’ll still complain about Supreme and comment on articles without reading them. But will you tune in to see who ends up on a box of Wheaties? Of course. Because we all want to see how it plays out when skateboarding joins the ranks of archery, shot put, javelin, snowboarding, and weightlifting.</p>

				<p>And, really, is anyone going to be that pissed if Ishod is grinning up on the podium, kissing a gold medal?</p>

				<p>Ultimately, skateboarding’s inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics is more symbolic of the state of the big-industry side of things than the culture of skating itself. Unlike the music industry, which created a structure early on that has since been dismantled, skateboarding was late to establish a corporate model, because it’s based around a physical act. But, as in music, the split is as simple as major label vs. indie: Just because the majors dominate the industry doesn’t mean you won’t have thriving indies that cater to the core.</p>

				<p>There will be a larger magnifying glass on skateboarding, which is going to affect its financials and economics, as well as its safety. Get ready to see more public parks enforce helmet rules, for fear of concussions, and age limits. Maybe, however, this intensified scrutiny will be a boon for smaller, under-the-radar companies, as it pushes more skaters into the streets or to backyard ramps, where they’re left to their own devices.</p>

				<p>The votes are in, though, and the medals will soon be up for grabs. What this means to you, and to skateboarding as a whole, is yours to decide. Skating’s always been caught in a push/pull relationship with big corporations and skater-owned brands, one that’s usually informed by the state of the American economy. Some people are cool with taking energy drink checks; others want to skate a ditch for fun and not think about the rest.</p>

				<p>The opportunity here is massive, and not just for those competing. Whether you care or not about the legitimacy the Olympics carries, the inclusion of a sport that was born in the United States is a big deal. I’m not getting all patriotic and shit, but it’s a massive achievement that could generate an influx of interest and capital to sustain skateboarding for years. Skating is a product-based sport, so unless you’re cool with it reverting to rollerskates nailed to stray pieces of wood, it needs money to survive.</p>

				<p>Regardless of your take, a lot will change in the next four years—whether you tune in or not. How it plays out is, in the end, your call.</p>
