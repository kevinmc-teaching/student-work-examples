        </div>

        <div class="main-article-content">
            <p>I met Andrea Lorenzo at her home in the suburb of Los Angeles on an airy summer day to discuss her personal style as an art director. At first glance,
                Andrea's house seems modest and nothing out of the ordinary, but out of
                everything, what caught my attention the most was the small wilting tree branch placed on top of her
                bedside table. I asked Andrea why she didn’t replace the branch with one that is blooming with flowers. Andrea smiled and said,
                “I am embracing wabi sabi”.</p>

            <div class="image-columns">
                <img src="images/annie-spratt_4.jpg" alt="Rustic white staircase with a cord basket">
                <img src="images/annie-spratt_3.jpg" alt="Old books on wooden bookshelf">
            </div>

            <p>The house was originally her parents’ former residence. Andrea’s father, Riccardo Lorenzo, who was an
                architect,
                built it for him and Andrea’s mother in 1984, but rented it out after moving back to Italy just a few
                years later. After graduating college and completing an internship at one
                of Milan’s leading design studios, Andrea decided to relocate to Los Angeles and took over her father's house.</p>

            <p>“At the time, the reason I moved to Los Angeles was simply because I felt that was the only way for me to
                step out of my comfort zone, from the familiar art scene of Europe and grow as a creative. Soon enough,
                however, it struck me that the opportunities that were offered to me come with a cost—the pressure of living in a
                fast-paced city where glamor and materialism are at the forefront of everything”, says Andrea. It was
                not
                until she visited an artisan pottery shop in Kyoto that she discovered the concept of wabi sabi. It is a worldview that has helped her find meaning and balance amidst the unrealistic ideals of perfection and
                flawlessness perpetuated by social media that dominate Western culture.</p>

            <div class="image-solo">
                <img src="images/annie-spratt_2_horizontal.jpg" alt="Clay pot and tableware with fruits on wooden table in minimal warm kitchen">
            </div>

            <p>“It is much more than minimalism and simplicity”, she says. “It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what wabi
                sabi is. To me, its essence lies in
                appreciating imperfection in all aspects of life.” After coming back from the trip, Andrea sought to
                bring that ethos into her work, lifestyle, and more importantly, her own home. Her home is the opposite of
                curated interiors. There are no sleek surfaces, clean lines nor symmetry. Each room is adorned with aged wood
                floors and furniture, while the white walls bear rustic scratches left behind by the passing of time.
            </p>

            <p>“Designer Kenya Hara once wrote in his book <em>White</em>, that white is emptiness; it is a vessel ready to be filled
                in; it is possibility. I think part of the reason why some people are so drawn to white as a color is due
                to its transient quality. Pure and beautiful in its original state, but easily soiled. White, to me, is
                the building block of wabi sabi”, says Andrea. Although Andrea uses white as a backdrop for her home, it
                doesn’t feel austere, rather, the marks and crevices on the walls along with ample of sunlight coming
                through the house's big windows lend a feeling of coziness to her home.</p>

            <p class="callout">“There is no beauty that is as raw and tender as the
                marks created by the effects of nature. </p>

            <div class="image-columns">
                <img src="images/elijah-beaton.jpg" alt="White lamp next to a black desk with sunlight shining through">
                <img src="images/nathan-dumlao.jpg" alt="Wooden ladder rested against the wall next to a straw laundry basket">
            </div>

            <p>Andrea's collection of decor and objects are all made from natural materials, from the straw laundry
                basket to the earthenware that grace her kitchen. “There is no beauty that is as raw and tender as the
                marks created by the effects of nature. Take handmade ceramic, for instance, you won't find two pieces that look exactly the
                same. Due to clay being a natural material, the ceramic will change its texture and even its shape as years go by”, she says. “Nothing screams wabi
                sabi than linen. The wrinkling and crumpled qualities of the fabric breathe life into my bedroom. It
                signifies the fact that someone is living here, that this is not just a house but a home.”</p>

            <p>Every corner of Andrea’s home takes on a life of its own, having its own story and standing the test of
                time. After the conversation with Andrea, it struck me that underneath a seemingly unattractive cover
                lies a muted beauty that can only be obtained in the moment, and its fleeting quality further adds to its
                value. The wilting branch, like all things, is impermanent, withered, yet so authentic. Its changing form
                is a reminder of growth, of complexity, of experience, and of life itself, which is imperfect.</p>
