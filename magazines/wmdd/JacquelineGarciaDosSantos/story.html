                        The free art movement is the practice of artists leaving art in public places as street art, as well as being free for the public to remove and keep.

                                Given the various benefits and high return on investment street art provides to business, schools, neighborhoods, and cities, a movement of using street art as a tool to create safer, brighter, more colorful and inspiring communities has also been recognized. Organizations like Beautify Earth have pioneered cities to leverage these benefits to create widespread beauty where it would be otherwise empty or dilapidated public wall space.

                                New York City attracts artists from around the world. In Manhattan, "post-graffiti" street art grew in the 1980s from the then largely vacant neighborhoods of SoHo and the Lower East Side. The Chelsea art district became another locale, with area galleries also hosting formal exhibitions of street artist's work. In Brooklyn, the Williamsburg and Dumbo neighborhoods — especially near the waterfront — are recognized street art sites.

                                Programs in the Pennsylvania cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh provide funding to agencies who employ street artists to decorate city walls. The Mural Arts Program established in 1984 has helped Philadelphia earn praise as the "City of Murals".<br>The project was initiated to encourage graffiti artists toward a more constructive use of their talents.
