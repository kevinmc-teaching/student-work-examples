                Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of
                traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes
                enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. Usually
                the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a
                thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half
                of
                the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in 25–30 cm (10–12 in) lengths. A variety of
                pasta
                dishes are based on it and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.

                    Fresh or dry spaghetti is cooked in a large pot of salted, boiling water and then drained in a colander
                    (Italian: scolapasta). In Italy, spaghetti is generally cooked al dente (Italian for "to the tooth"), fully cooked but still
                    firm
                    to the bite. It may also be cooked to a softer consistency.

                        Spaghettoni is a thicker spaghetti which takes more time to cook. Spaghettini is a thinner form which
                        takes
                        less time to cook. Capellini is a very thin form of spaghetti (it is also called "angel hair spaghetti"
                        or
                        "angel hair pasta") which cooks very quickly.

            </h4>
            <p>
                An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with tomato sauce, which may contain
                various
                herbs (especially oregano and basil), olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations
                include
                amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano, Parmesan and Grana Padano, are
                often
                sprinkled on top.
            </p>
            <h4>
                International cuisine
            </h4>
            <p>
                In some countries, spaghetti is sold in cans/tins with sauce.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the United States, it is sometimes served with chili con carne. Unlike in Italy, in other countries
                spaghetti is often served with Bolognese sauce.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Philippines, an immensely popular variant is the Filipino spaghetti, which is distinctively sweet
                with the tomato sauce sweetened with banana ketchup or sugar. It typically uses a large amount of
                giniling
                (ground meat), sliced hotdogs, and cheese. The dish dates back to the period between the 1940s to the
                1960s.
                During the American Commonwealth Period, a shortage of tomato supplies in the Second World War forced
                the
                development of the banana ketchup. Spaghetti was introduced by the Americans and was tweaked to suit the
                local Filipino predilection for sweet dishes.

                Sapaketti phat khi mao (Spaghetti fried drunken noodle style) is a popular dish in Thai cuisine.
