        <p class="para clear">The traditional American spread of fried eggs, bacon, toast and possibly potatoes might seem like an oddly heavy way to start the day to someone from France or Japan, for example. In France, the typical morning meal consists of a light snack, such as a baguette with a spread of butter and jam, or maybe the famous "Parisian breakfast" of a freshly baked croissant and a cup of coffee. In Japan, a bowl of miso soup and rice is not uncommon in the morning, and in several parts of the world, a sweet or savory porridge is a common way to start the day.</p>
