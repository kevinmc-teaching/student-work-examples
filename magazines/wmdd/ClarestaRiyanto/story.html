        <h1>LESS IS MORE. <span>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</span></h1>

    <div class="main-articlepage">
        <div class="article-background">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</span> was a German-American architect. He was commonly
                referred to as Mies, his surname.
                Along with Alvar Aalto, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Frank Lloyd Wright, he is regarded as <span
                    class="italic">one of the
                    pioneers of modernist architecture.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Mies sought to establish his own particular architectural style that could represent modern times just
                as
                Classical and Gothic did for their own eras. He created his own twentieth-century architectural style,
                stated with extreme clarity and simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as
                industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces, as also conducted by other modernist
                architects
                in the 1920s and 1930s such as Richard Neutra. Mies strove toward an architecture with a minimal
                framework
                of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of unobstructed free-flowing open space. He
                called
                his buildings "skin and bones" architecture. He sought an objective approach that would guide the
                creative
                process of architectural design, but was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era.
                He
                is often associated with his fondness for the aphorisms, <span class="italic">"less is more"</span> and
                <span class="italic">
                    "God is in the details"
                </span>

                    This building was used for the official opening of the German section of the exhibition. It is an
                    important building in the history of modern architecture, known for its simple form and its
                    spectacular use of extravagant materials, such as marble, red onyx and travertine. The same features
                    of minimalism and spectacular can be applied to the prestigious furniture specifically designed for
                    the building, including the iconic Barcelona chair. It has inspired many important modernist
                    buildings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Pavilion was not only a pioneer for construction forms with a fresh, disciplined understanding
                    of space, but also for modelling new opportunities for an association of free art and architecture.
                    Mies placed Georg Kolbe's Alba ("Dawn") in the small water basin, leaving the larger one all the
                    more empty. The sculpture also ties into the highly reflective materials Mies used—he chose the
                    place where these optical effects would have the strongest impact; the building offers multiple
                    views of Alba. "From now on, in the sense of equality for juxtaposing building and visual work,
                    sculptures were no longer to be applied retrospectively to the building, but rather to be a part of
                    the spatial design, to help define and interpret it. To the day, one of the most notable examples is
                    the Barcelona Pavilion".

                    Between 1946 and 1951, Mies van der Rohe designed and built the Farnsworth House, a weekend
                    retreat outside
                    Chicago for an independent professional woman, Dr. Edith Farnsworth. Here, Mies explored the
                    relationship
                    between people, shelter, and nature. The glass pavilion is raised six feet above a floodplain
                    next to the
                    Fox River, surrounded by forest and rural prairies.

                <p>
                    The highly crafted pristine white structural frame and all-glass walls define a simple
                    rectilinear interior
                    space, allowing nature and light to envelop the interior space. A wood-paneled fireplace (also
                    housing
                    mechanical equipment, kitchen, and toilets) is positioned within the open space to suggest
                    living, dining
                    and sleeping spaces without using walls. No partitions touch the surrounding all-glass
                    enclosure. Without
                    solid exterior walls, full-height draperies on a perimeter track allow freedom to provide full
                    or partial
                    privacy when and where desired. The house has been described as sublime, a temple hovering
                    between heaven
                    and earth, a poem, a work of art.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Farnsworth House and its 60-acre (240,000 m2) wooded site was purchased at auction for
                    US$7.5 million by
                    preservation groups in 2004 and is now owned and operated by the National Trust for Historic
                    Preservation as
                    a public museum. The building influenced the creation of hundreds of modernist glass houses,
                    most notably
                    the Glass House by Philip Johnson, located near New York City and also now owned by the National
                    Trust.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The house is an embodiment of Mies' mature vision of modern architecture for the new
                    technological age: a
                    single unencumbered space within a minimal "skin and bones" framework, a clearly understandable
                    arrangement
                    of architectural parts. His ideas are stated with clarity and simplicity, using materials that
                    are
                    configured to express their own individual character.

                <p>
                    Mies van der Rohe designed several dozen buildings for the southern side Illinois Institute of
                    Technology. Most of these structures employ a brick and glass infill system within an exposed steel
                    frame. When he was given the opportunity to design Crown Hall in 1950, Mies deviated from the norm
                    and built a totally different structure which no one had seen before.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Widely regarded as one of Mies van der Rohe's masterpieces, Crown Hall, completed in 1956, is one of
                    the most architecturally significant buildings of the 20th century Modernist movement. Crown Hall is
                    considered architecturally significant because Mies van der Rohe refined the basic steel and glass
                    construction style, beautifully capturing simplicity and openness for endless new uses. Creating
                    this openness was achieved by the building having a suspended roof, without the need for interior
                    columns. This created a universal space that could be endlessly adapted to new uses. Typically,
                    older buildings up to 1956 had columns to support the roof from caving in, but Crown Hall does not
                    require them. While designing Crown Hall, Mies stayed true to his famous words, "less is more" and
                    he considered the building to be the best embodiment of the maxim.
                </p>
                <p>At the time of being built, the
                    idea of providing a single large room for the school of architecture and city planning's 300
                    students was to be particularly workable, and for the student to not be isolated from others who may
                    be further or less advanced in the course then he/she. Although, shortly after being built,
                    Architects began to question the relevancy of Mie’s work. Many architects depicted Crown Hall as,
                    "slipping beneath the waves of Lake Michigan to a watery grave." After a number of years, Crown Hall
                    was seen as such a successful icon of modern architecture that it served as the foil for Chicago
                    architect Stanley Tigerman's 1978 satirical collage titled “The Titanic”.
