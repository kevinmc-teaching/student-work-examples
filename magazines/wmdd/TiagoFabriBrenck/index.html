								<h3>Snowboard in Austria</h3>
							</header>

								As known as Europe snowboard capital, Austria has several resorts and mountains that attracts millions of tourists every winter. The most famous city, Tirol, has host big events and it is located in the middle of the alpis. Surrounded by gorgeous mountains, Tirol definetely is a place to consider visiting.
							</p>
							<p class="main-tease">
								Another interesting fact about Austria is that all resorts offer free snowboard courses for their hosts. This saves you a lot of money because there are some places that cost you $250 daily for that kind of course. There are no age restriction to practice snowboard but it is required that the person doesnt have any knee issue or arthrose. Before booking your tickets, have a consult with your doctor and ask him if you are good to practice the sport. 
							</p>
							<p class="main-tease">
								Austria has also good cousine tradition and an active night life. After spending your day snowboarding, consider yourself to try Tafelspitz(boiled beef), the traditional hams or German sausages. After eating, a good suggestion is to go parties provided by the resorts. Some of them are even free for entrance.
