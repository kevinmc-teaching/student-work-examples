				<h2>Introduction:</h2>
				<p>Denise Ma a Singaporean artist based in Vancouver, BC is our first pick for this issue of Scratch. We ask her to tell us more about herself and her artworks.</p>

				<p>Most of her artworks seem to circle around her personal experiences and she often draws inspiration from her childhood. Her paintings are dark and sit on the border of the surreal. This series of paintings were done for an exhibition as a final year project. Each painting was hand sewn into bedding accessories such as pillows and blankets. Her work explored the psyche and its connections to common reoccurring dreams. Along with these pictures was a single dream journal, containing all her dream from the age of 9 and at the back separate section filled with dreams of people she had met.</p>

					<h3>The Self-Indulgent Artist</h3>
					<p>Among the many struggles that I have faced as an artist, seeking approval from my family and the internal conflict that arises during the creation of these artworks due to my conservative background. I find the hardest part art of creating art for me is facing criticism and falling into self-indulgence in attempts to express a certain thought. Camille Rose Garcia, an artist I looked up to since I was a teen was described as "pretty pictures lack specific meaning and specific context…their insistent vagueness, smugness, blanket pronouncements, lack of nuance and grating self-righteousness add up to a static portrait / shallow response to something complex: I get it; things are bad. It's disappointing to find out that the impetus for these works isn't skillful."
					</p>

					<p>I proceeded to create this project knowing that this series of works wouldn't fly well with the institution I was in. As expected I was met with criticism and a low grade, but I felt that I had a story to tell and even tho it probably did not touch the masses, people relate.</p>

						<h4>The Lucidity of Dreams</h4>
						<p>Dreams, in Freud's view, are all forms of "wish fulfillment" — attempts by the unconscious to resolve a conflict of some sort, whether something recent or something from the recesses of the past (later in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud would discuss dreams which do not appear to be wish-fulfillment). Because the information in the unconscious is in an unruly and often disturbing form, a "censor" in the preconscious will not allow it to pass unaltered into the conscious.</p>

						<p>During dreams, the preconscious is more lax in this duty than in waking hours, but is still attentive: as such, the unconscious must distort and warp the meaning of its information to make it through the censorship. As such, images in dreams are often not what they appear to be, according to Freud, and need deeper interpretation if they are to inform on the structures of the unconscious.</p>

						<p>Freud used to mention the dreams as "The Royal Road to the Unconscious". He proposed the 'phenomenon of condensation'; the idea that one simple symbol or image presented in a person's dream may have multiple meanings. For this very reason, Freud tried to focus on details during psychoanalysis and asked his patients about things they could even think trivial (i.e. while a patient was describing an experience in their dream, Freud could ask them: "was there any sign upon the walls? What was it?").
						</p>

						<p>As Freud was focusing upon the biologic drives of the individual (a fact that alienated him from several colleagues of his like Breuer, Jung and Adler), he stated that when we observe a hollow object in our dreams, like a box or a cave, this is a symbol of a womb, while an elongated object is a symbol for penis. Due to these statements, Freud attracted much criticism from those who believed him a "sexist" or "misanthrope", as he was alleged to have overemphasized the role of instinct, as though he believed people were "wild beasts". I read on Freud's theories and pondered on them as I continued to record my dreams and translate them onto canvas in both figurative and abstract shapes.</p>

							<h4>Inspirations</h4>
							<p>Apart from drawing inspirations from my childhood, stylistically and conceptually I get my inspirations from other artists and movements as well.</p>

							<p>Magritte's work frequently displays a collection of ordinary objects in an unusual context, giving new meanings to familiar things. The use of objects as other than what they seem is typified in his painting, and often plays with contradictions</p>

							<p>I get most style inspiration from pop surrealism within the Lowbrow movement in fields not normally considered fine art, such as illustration, tattooing and comic books. Many of these artists are self-taught, and I find myself amazed and aspire to adapt their displine and dedication.</p>
