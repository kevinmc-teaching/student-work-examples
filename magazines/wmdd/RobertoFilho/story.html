			There is nothing better than coming home to find my two little dogs waiting for me. They love to run to the lawn and "go to the washroom" before I take care of several things in the house. By the time they are done with their first necessities, they come to say hello like I had disappeared for months, and it just fills my heart with so much innocent love. Each one has its unique way of showing love: Max lowers his head and skips while coming in my direction, while Kiko ... well, Kiko is a real mess; He shows all his tricks, jumps, licks, runs in circles, all at the same time. Seeing as how this happens every single time I leave and return — and it probably happens with you and your four-legged friend, too — what’s the deal? Why are they always so excited to see me when I come home?</p>

			<p class="insider">Science does have an answer for us. There are two factors for this: 1) how dogs have evolved over the years from wolves and maintain the same behavior as their ancestries; 2) plain curiosity.</p>

			<p class="insider">According to speciallist Dinaw Soahr, before dogs were our friends around the house, they were wild wolves. Way back then they used to greet each other by licking their faces as humans shake hands, also to sniff out if any another member of the pack has brought dinner home that night. The reaction that dogs have to a familiar person is very similar to how humans react to their friends. Just like how we all get happy at the thought of hanging out with our best friends, that's basically how dogs see us.</p>

			<p class="insider">Soahr has also tested how dogs see humans: as members of their “wolf pack” or as a completely different species? She discovered, through scent tests, that dogs could identify their owners' familiar scent.</p>

			<p class="insider">According to the specialist, dogs know that we’re something different, there’s a special place in their brain just for us. What we’re finding with the imaging work is that dogs really love their owner. They love the company of humans simply for its own sake.</p>

			<p class="insider">Soahr also indicates that dogs do not think in abstract concepts as humans do, therefore, when a dog sees us and if we’ve been gone from its presence all day, the dog has probably gotten bored without anything to do neither company, furthermore the second it meets us, the dog is happy, but also wants to know where we’ve been. That’s why there’s a lot of smelling and face licking, its curiosity to know if we’ve been with other dogs, and also if we’ve brought food for them.</p>

			<p class="insider">Hence, there are much more to be discovered but one thing is for sure: there is nothing like a dog’s welcoming reception and the everyday red carpet your fellow paw shall through even if you are only going to greet them, play a little bit or take a long walk by its side, the dog is just glad you’re back.</p>

			<p class="insider">Several other studies have been made to show the relation between dogs and humans, but nothing can prove more affinity than our love for these little (and big) furry fellows. And just by the way they approach us, the way they stick around no matter what... We can say that the love is mutual.</p>
