<h3>Vinyasa</h3>
<p>Vinyasa (pronounced “vin-yah-sah”) is a Sanskrit word for a phrase that roughly translates as “to place in a special way.” Vinyasa classes are known for their fluid, movement-intensive practices. Vinyasa teachers choreograph their classes to smoothly transition from pose to pose, and often play music to keep things lively. The intensity of the practice is similar to Ashtanga, but no two vinyasa classes are the same.

  <h3>Ashtanga</h3>
  <p>Ashtanga is based on ancient yoga teachings, but it was popularized and brought to the West by Pattabhi Jois in the 1970s. It’s a rigorous style of yoga that follows a specific sequence of postures and is similar to vinyasa yoga, as each style links every movement to a breath. The difference is that Ashtanga always performs the exact same poses in the exact same order. This is a hot, sweaty, physically demanding practice.

<h3>Iyengar</h3>
<p>Iyengar yoga was developed and popularized by B.K.S. Iyengar.Iyengar is a very meticulous style of yoga, with utmost attention paid to finding the proper alignment in a pose. There isn’t a lot of jumping around in Iyengar classes, so you won’t get your heart rate up, but you’ll be amazed to discover how physically and mentally challenging it is to stay put. if you have an injury or chronic condition, Iyengar is probably your best choice to ensure you get the knowledgeable instruction you need.

  <h3>Bikram</h3>
  <p>About 30 years ago, Bikram Choudhury developed this school of yoga where classes are held in artificially heated rooms. In a Bikram class, you will sweat like never before as you work your way through a series of 26 poses. Like Ashtanga, a Bikram class always follows the same sequence, although a Bikram sequence is different from an ashtanga sequence. Bikram is somewhat controversial, as Choudhury has trademarked his sequence and has sued studios who call themselves Bikram but don’t teach the poses exactly the way he says they should. It’s also wildly popular, making it one of the easiest classes to find.

<h3>Hatha</h3>
<p>Hatha yoga is a generic term that refers to any type of yoga that teaches physical postures. Nearly every type of yoga class taught in the West is hatha yoga. When a class is marketed as hatha, it generally means that you will get a gentle introduction to the most basic yoga postures. You probably won’t work up a sweat in a hatha yoga class, but you should end up leaving class feeling longer, looser, and more relaxed.
