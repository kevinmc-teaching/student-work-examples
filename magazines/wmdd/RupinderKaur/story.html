		<h2>Crescent Rolls, Cream Cheese and Grapefruit: An Easy Recipe for Kids</h2>
		<img src="images/crescent-roll.jpg" alt="crescent-roll" class="story-image">
		<div class="paragraph-r">
			<p>Cooking with kids can be a challenge, but there’s no need to tackle hollandaise or souffles. When looking for a kid-friendly recipe, choose something that’s simple and hands-on.For example, the following recipe for Texas Reds in a Blanket involves spreading cream cheese, folding refrigerated crescent roll dough and sprinkling cinnamon sugar, giving junior pastry chefs plenty to do. The accompanying sauce only requires the use of a microwave, though you should handle any hot bowls or cookie sheets yourself.Use Texas Rio Star Grapefruit, which is sweeter than other varieties of grapefruit. The grapefruit season runs from October to May. When buying grapefruit, look for fruits that feel heavy for their size, as that indicates a juicy fruit.</p>

		<h2>A Recipe for a Healthier Lunch</h2>
		<img src="images/ja-ma-216495.jpg" alt="Healthier" class="story-image">
		<div class="paragraph-l"><p>Those who want to save money and improve their diets can’t do better than brown-bagging their lunch.

			Look for recipes that use fresh, whole ingredients and that combine protein with healthy carbohydrates. For example, the following recipe for Rio Star Grapefruit & Quinoa Salad combines vegetables and citrus fruit with quinoa, a whole grain that supplies a complete protein.

			Quinoa, which is like couscous in texture, contains protein, iron, fiber and vitamin B6, while fresh grapefruit contains vitamins A and C. Look for Texas Rio Star Grapefruit, a red variety that’s especially sweet. When choosing grapefruit, pick one that feels heavy for its size – that means that it’s extra juicy.</p></div>
