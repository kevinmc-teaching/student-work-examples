    <p><strong>Hot chocolate</strong>, also known as Chocolate tea, drinking chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. <strong>Hot chocolate</strong> may be topped with whipped cream. <strong>Hot chocolate</strong> made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.</p>

    <p>The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl. The beverage became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, <strong>hot chocolate</strong> was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.</p>

    <p>In the 2010s, <strong>hot chocolate</strong> is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared <strong>hot chocolate</strong> can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and cafes. Powdered <strong>hot chocolate</strong> mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores.</p>

    <p>Today, <strong>hot chocolate</strong> in the form of drinking chocolate or cocoa is considered a comfort food and is widely consumed in many parts of the world. European <strong>hot chocolate</strong> tends to be relatively thick and rich, while in the United States the thinner instant version is consumed more often. In Nigeria <strong>hot chocolate</strong> is referred to as "tea" even though it is not actually a tea due to the Nigerian custom of referring to drinks consumed in the morning as "tea". Many regions have distinctive additives or toppings, ranging from marshmallow and whipped cream to cheese.
    </p>

    <p>In the United States and Canada, the drink is popular in instant form, made with hot water or milk from a packet containing mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk. This is the thinner of the two main variations. It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, or a piece of solid chocolate. <strong>Hot chocolate</strong> was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling <strong>hot chocolate</strong> was around 1755. Traditionally, <strong>hot chocolate</strong> has been associated with cold weather, winter, and dessert in the United States and Canada.</p>

    <p>In Mexico, <strong>hot chocolate</strong> remains a popular national drink, often including semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. <strong>Hot chocolate</strong> of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon <strong>hot chocolate</strong> as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.</p>
